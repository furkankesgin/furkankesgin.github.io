    <p>Hi my name is Furkan KESGİN,  I was born in 1997. I finished primary school in Atatürk Primary School,
        middle school Osman SAÇMACI and then Sarıyer Anatolian Imam Hatip Highschool.Right now, I study in Computer Education
        and Introduction Technology Department. When I came to university I started
    English preparation and met a person who is interest in cyber security and then I started to care about the cyber
        security. I am trying to learn many necessary programs for this.Also I am taking online network courses.
        Besides these, I also try to learn robotics sets to be able to master the education part of my department.
    My main goal is to be able to choose the area that I want to specialize with various studies then I will strive
        to specialize in the area I chose.</p>
