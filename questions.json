      "Gray box testing",
      "White box testing"
    ],
    "answer": "Black box testing",
    "explanation": "Answer: Black box testing\n\nIn black box testing, the tester simulates an attack from someone who has no prior knowledge about the system. This requires extensive reconnaissance to gather information about the network and its vulnerabilities. In contrast, white box testing involves prior knowledge of the system, leading to reduced or skipped reconnaissance phases. Gray box testing involves partial knowledge, making it less intensive than black box but more than white box. Unit testing is focused on individual components and generally does not involve reconnaissance."

    "question": "Which of the following scanning methods is considered to be the least reliable due to the lack of error correction mechanisms?",
    "choices": [
      "TCP Connect Scan",
      "SYN Scan",
      "UDP Scan",
      "ACK Scan"
    ],
    "answer": "UDP Scan",
    "explanation": "UDP Scans are considered to be the least reliable because they do not involve establishing a connection with the target. They send packets without verifying if the target is available or not, leading to potential data loss and missed responses. This is in contrast to TCP-based scans like SYN or Connect scans, which ensure that a connection is established before communicating."
